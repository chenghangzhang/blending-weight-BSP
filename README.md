# Blending Weight BSP Tree for Mesh Boolean Operations

This program can generate efficiency BSP Tree for efficient splitting of models.

## Our splitting method and Compared Method
The coding of our splitting method and compared methods are shown in ../BSP3/mBool/BoolOperate/Intersect/Accelerator/BSP/BSPTree/BSPNode.cpp

## Test models
The testing models are stored in TestModels floder. The mainly important models are in \thingi10k and \batch bool. They are testing for tree qualities and the Boolean operation times, respectively.
